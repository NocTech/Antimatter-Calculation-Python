# Antimatter-Calculation-Python
Python script that calculates the energy released when a given mass of antimatter and an equal mass of matter annihilate. This script uses Einstein’s equation  𝐸 = 𝑚 𝑐 2 E=mc  2  .  The user can input the mass of antimatter (in grams), and the script will calculate the total energy released in joules.
